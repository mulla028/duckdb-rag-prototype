# Climate Change: Data, Trends, and Analysis

## Global Temperature Records

Global mean surface temperature (GMST) has increased by approximately 1.1°C since the pre-industrial period (1850-1900). The most recent decade (2011-2020) was the warmest on record. The years 2016 and 2020 were the warmest individual years in the modern temperature record.

- 2020: 3.92
- 2023: 4.23

## Sea Level Rise

Global mean sea level has risen by approximately 21-24 cm since 1880, with the rate accelerating in recent decades due to increased ice sheet and glacier melt, as well as thermal expansion of ocean water.

### Sea Level Rise Rates
- 1901-2000: 1.4 mm/year
- 1971-2018: 2.3 mm/year
- 1993-2015: 3.1 mm/year
- 2006-2018: 3.7 mm/year
- 2018-2023: 4.5 mm/year

## Extreme Weather Events

Climate change is increasing the frequency and intensity of certain extreme weather events, including heat waves, heavy precipitation, droughts, and tropical cyclones.

### Global Heat Wave Frequency (compared to 1951-1980 baseline)
- 1950s: -0.21 (below average frequency)
- 1970s: -0.08 (slightly below average)
- 1990s: +0.32 (above average)
- 2010s: +0.72 (significantly above average)
- 2020-2023: +0.94 (dramatically above average)

### Category 4-5 Hurricane Percentage (of total hurricanes)
- 1980-1989: 25%
- 1990-1999: 28%
- 2000-2009: 32%
- 2010-2019: 38%
- 2020-2023: 42%

## Carbon Budget and Emissions

To limit warming to 1.5°C above pre-industrial levels, the remaining carbon budget is estimated at approximately 400 GtCO₂ from 2023 onward. Current annual global CO₂ emissions are approximately 37 GtCO₂, meaning the budget would be exhausted in roughly 10-12 years at current emission rates.

### Annual CO₂ Emissions by Region (GtCO₂)
- China: 11.47 (31% of global total)
- United States: 5.01 (14%)
- European Union: 2.73 (7%)
- India: 2.65 (7%)
- Russia: 1.94 (5%)
- Japan: 1.15 (3%)
- Rest of World: 12.05 (33%)

## Climate Sensitivity and Feedback Mechanisms

Climate sensitivity refers to the amount of warming expected from a doubling of atmospheric CO₂. The likely range is 2.5°C to 4.0°C, with a best estimate of 3.0°C.

### Key Feedback Mechanisms
- Water vapor feedback: +1.8 W/m² per °C (amplifying)
- Ice-albedo feedback: +0.3 W/m² per °C (amplifying)
- Cloud feedback: +0.5 W/m² per °C (amplifying)
- Lapse rate feedback: -0.6 W/m² per °C (dampening)

## Tipping Points and Irreversible Changes

Several components of the Earth system may have critical thresholds beyond which large-scale, potentially irreversible changes can occur.

### Potential Tipping Elements
- Greenland Ice Sheet: Threshold estimated at 1.5-2.0°C above pre-industrial
- West Antarctic Ice Sheet: Threshold uncertain, possibly already committed
- Amazon Rainforest: Threshold estimated at 3-4°C with reduced precipitation
- Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation: Threshold estimated at 3-5°C
- Permafrost Carbon Release: Gradual thawing ongoing, accelerates >2°C

## Mitigation Pathways

To limit warming to 1.5°C, global net anthropogenic CO₂ emissions need to decline by about 45% from 2010 levels by 2030, reaching net zero around 2050.

### Required Emission Reductions by Sector (% change by 2030 compared to 2019)
- Energy: -60% to -75%
- Industry: -40% to -55%
- Buildings: -45% to -60%
- Transport: -35% to -50%
- Agriculture, Forestry and Other Land Use: -20% to -30%

## Climate Model Projections

Climate models project future warming based on different emissions scenarios. Under high emissions (SSP5-8.5), warming could reach 4.4°C by 2100. Under low emissions (SSP1-1.9), warming could be limited to 1.5°C.

### Projected Warming by 2100 (relative to 1850-1900)
- Very low emissions (SSP1-1.9): 1.4°C (range: 1.0-1.8°C)
- Low emissions (SSP1-2.6): 1.8°C (range: 1.3-2.4°C)
- Intermediate emissions (SSP2-4.5): 2.7°C (range: 2.1-3.5°C)
- High emissions (SSP3-7.0): 3.6°C (range: 2.8-4.6°C)
- Very high emissions (SSP5-8.5): 4.4°C (range: 3.3-5.7°C)

## Impacts at Different Warming Levels

Climate impacts vary significantly at different levels of warming.

### 1.5°C vs. 2.0°C Impacts
- Species losing >50% of climatically determined range: 6% vs. 18% of insects, 8% vs. 16% of plants, 4% vs. 8% of vertebrates
- Population exposed to severe heat at least once every 5 years: 14% vs. 37%
- Global population exposed to severe drought: 9% vs. 12%
- Sea level rise by 2100: 0.4m vs. 0.46m

- California Drought 2012-2014: 15-20% more severe due to climate change
- Hurricane Harvey Rainfall 2017: 3 times more likely, 15% more intense
- Australian Bushfires 2019-2020: At least 30% more likely
