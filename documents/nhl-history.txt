# NHL History

## Origins and Formation
The National Hockey League (NHL) was established on November 26, 1917, in Montreal, Quebec, after the suspension of operations of the National Hockey Association (NHA). The NHL began with four teams: the Montreal Canadiens, Montreal Wanderers, Ottawa Senators, and Toronto Arenas. The league was formed during World War I amidst a series of disputes within the NHA.

## Early Expansion
In 1924, the NHL expanded into the United States with the Boston Bruins joining as the first American team. The New York Americans, Pittsburgh Pirates, and Detroit Cougars (later Red Wings) soon followed. By 1926, the NHL had grown to ten teams, but the Great Depression later forced several teams to cease operations.

## Original Six Era (1942-1967)
From 1942 to 1967, the NHL consisted of what became known as the "Original Six" teams:
- Boston Bruins
- Chicago Black Hawks (now Blackhawks)
- Detroit Red Wings
- Montreal Canadiens
- New York Rangers
- Toronto Maple Leafs

This period is often remembered for fierce rivalries and legendary players like Maurice "Rocket" Richard, Gordie Howe, and Terry Sawchuk.

## Major Expansion (1967-1979)
In 1967, the NHL doubled in size by adding six teams: the Los Angeles Kings, Minnesota North Stars, Oakland Seals, Philadelphia Flyers, Pittsburgh Penguins, and St. Louis Blues. This marked the beginning of a major expansion period.

The 1970s saw further growth with the addition of:
- Buffalo Sabres and Vancouver Canucks (1970)
- New York Islanders and Atlanta Flames (1972)
- Kansas City Scouts and Washington Capitals (1974)

The league also faced competition from the World Hockey Association (WHA) from 1972 to 1979, which affected player salaries and team rosters.

## Modern Era Developments
In 1979, the NHL merged with the WHA, adding four teams: the Edmonton Oilers, Hartford Whalers, Quebec Nordiques, and Winnipeg Jets.

The 1990s and 2000s saw continued expansion into non-traditional hockey markets:
- San Jose Sharks (1991)
- Ottawa Senators and Tampa Bay Lightning (1992)
- Florida Panthers and Mighty Ducks of Anaheim (1993)
- Nashville Predators (1998)
- Atlanta Thrashers (1999)
- Minnesota Wild and Columbus Blue Jackets (2000)

The NHL currently consists of 32 teams with the addition of the Vegas Golden Knights (2017) and Seattle Kraken (2021).
